Greetings! I am Viktor Brešan, a seasoned software developer with over 25 years of experience in all phases of product development. 

My journey has taken me through a diverse range of companies, from large corporations to mid-sized firms and innovative startups. In 2009, I took a leap of faith and founded [Binary Solutions](https://binarysolutions.biz/) as a solopreneur. This venture has resulted in the creation of numerous Android apps and web applications. These Android apps have collectively amassed millions of downloads and have occasionally topped the charts.

In the spirit of transparency, collaboration and knowledge sharing, I have decided to open-source some of these apps. This decision was also motivated by the current market dominance of Google and the challenges that indie developers face. I believe that open-source software can provide a counterbalance, fostering a more diverse and fair app ecosystem. 

I invite you to explore the projects that are available on my GitHub profile. If you find them interesting or useful, don't hesitate to [show your support](https://ko-fi.com/vbresan) or contribute to them. Your input is greatly appreciated.
